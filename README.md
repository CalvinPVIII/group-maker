# Group Maker

### Features:
- Easily create randomized groups
- Drag and drop names to customize groups
- Group history is tracked, easily see how many times people have been in the same group together

Also available as a native desktop app via electron, although that version may not be as up to date as the web app.

Currently there are no known bugs. If you encounter any bugs, feel free to submit an issue on github
