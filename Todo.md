### Features:

- Blacklist
- Customize pairs
- Delete functionality for cohort/people
- Manually assign pairs

### Bug fixes:

- Once pairs have been assigned, there are some bugs with moving people between groups. Will also need to add functionality for updating pair history
- People not in a pair won't be displayed in a group if they pairs have been assigned
- Currently I can check who is not in a group, need to then see if I can add them to an existing group
- Need to check who is in a group, and not in a pair, so they can still be displayed in the group section
