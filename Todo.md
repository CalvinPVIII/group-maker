### Features:

- Blacklist
- Customize pairs
- Delete functionality for cohort/people

### Bug fixes:

- Once pairs have been assigned, there are some bugs with moving people between groups. Will also need to add functionality for updating pair history
- People not in a pair won't be displayed in a group if they pairs have been assigned
  - ~~Check who is in a group but not in a pair, and who is not in a group or pair but in a cohort~~
  - Currently I can check who is not in a group, need to then see if I can add them to an existing group
