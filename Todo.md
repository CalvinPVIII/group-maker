### Features:

### Bug fixes:

- ~~Once pairs have been assigned, there are some bugs with moving people between groups. Will also need to add functionality for updating pair history~~
- ~~People not in a pair won't be displayed in a group if they pairs have been assigned~~
- ~~Currently I can check who is not in a group, need to then see if I can add them to an existing group~~
- ~~Need to check who is in a group, and not in a pair, so they can still be displayed in the group section~~
